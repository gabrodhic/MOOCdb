11/2/13

- Print the passage out and go through it by yourself
  - look for observations and stuff

- After drawing your own conclusions, go through the study bible
  - The Gospel Transformation Bible
- Read the notes that they have in the study bible.
- Then read through the commentaries
  - this is where you get the context stuff
- in the study bible and commentary, there's points that they make
  - cross examine it with your notes and get your main points
- AT THIS POINT, YOU SHOULD HAVE SOME MAIN POINTS READY FOR THE BIBLE STUDY

- Formulate some questions to ask for the interpretation part
- Then create some application points

Points specific to Acts
- there's an Intervarsity bible study prep material for Acts
  - www.intervarsity.org/bible-studies/acts-6

Points to consider for **DURING** the Bible Study
- What happens if the discussion goes way off track from what you intended
  - Gauge the group and eventually try and lead it back to the main points
