6.885 Lecture 3 (Data Cleaning and Integration #1) - 9/12/13

-- From last lecture

Takes unstructured text -("cleaning")> structured text/data

**What goes around comes around paper**

XML
  - schema later model (vs. schema first)
    - schema later is useful for when you have two data sets and you want to merge them at a later time
    - schema later is very attractive for people who really quickly want to have something up
    - when you get to a production environment, everything you send around pretty much conforms to your schema.

Support for complex (user defined) types/operations
  + the user defines custom types and operations on their data
  - code to data
  - bad for modularity
  - terrible for portability

Support for a notion of ordering (like time ordering) in data
  - "find the earliest entry before this point in time"
  - SQL does not support this (can't look arbitrary number of timestamps before or after something)

**Data Wrangler Demo**
