\section{Future Work}

CommunityFinder is first and foremost a tool to do community analysis. As such, it is meant to be used to do further research on MOOCs. The functionality should grow to accommodate the needs of the people using the tool. Thus, it will be important to see how people use CommunityFinder.

The are a few good ideas already for future features. For instance, CommunityFinder could implement other community detection algorithms. There has been a lot of work on other algorithm that have not been tested. Some of the most interesting are the ones that do not limit a student to being in only one community. Developing support overlapping communities is a one possible future feature. A second feature is one that tracks how community structure changes over time. Researchers might want to know how a community morphs week to week in order to assess how effectively course material is being taught.

Finally, an interesting project would be to use CommunityFinder to relate superposters (as identified by Huang et al.) to their community assignment.
