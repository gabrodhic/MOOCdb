\section{Introduction}
Massively online open courses, or MOOCs, are offered by universities across the country, including MIT. Over 100 classes are offered on platforms like edX and Coursera and this number is growing. Due to the nature of being online and open, a lot of data is being collected about how students interact with the course material.

The discussion forums in these classes are the primary way that students and teachers interact in these online courses. For example, the first offering of 6.002x  (Circuits and Electronics) in Spring 2012 had over 90,000 posts made.

In this paper, we present CommunityFinder, which is software that extracts structured representation of how student interact with MOOCs and then performs community analysis on this structured representation. The software outputs information on several aspects of the community structure in an online course.
