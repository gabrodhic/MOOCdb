\section{Motivation} 
Understanding the community structure of a graph can bring improved understanding of complex systems. MOOCs provide a new complexity to education in not only the size of their enrollment, but also in the different way that they teach material. If we understand qualitatively how students interact with each other and instructors in a course, we will be able to better understand how successes and failures of MOOCs. This understanding will allow educators to improve these online course moving forward.
